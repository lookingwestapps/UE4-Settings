===================================

Fork of [ImpetusGames/UE4-Settings](https://github.com/ImpetusGames/UE4-Settings) to use it as a UE4 plugin.


__Usage__

Unzip the [zip](https://github.com/selaoll/UE4-Settings/VideoSettings.zip) into the Plugins directory of your game. (Create the directory if it doesn't exist)

To add it as an engine plugin you will need to unzip it into the plugin directory under where you installed UE4, for example *../UnrealEngine/4.10/Engine/Plugins*
